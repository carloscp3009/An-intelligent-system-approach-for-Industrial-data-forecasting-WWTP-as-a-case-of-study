# *(Unofficial)* La Trobe PhD Thesis LaTeX Template

This is a slightly modified version of [Bashimao's](https://github.com/bashimao/ltu-thesis) La Trobe latex template based on the classicthesis thesis template by [André Miede](https://bitbucket.org/amiede/classicthesis).

I've made slight changes so that the margins meet the requirements of the physics department. I've changed the language to Australian. I've also added an acronym page and appendices.

Most importantly, I've uploaded it to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) as a [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/unofficial-la-trobe-university-template/zqzzvmxvbxqg).


## Organization
`thesis.tex` is the root document and includes the individual chapters. The content of the chapters can be found under `text/`. It is pretty self-explanatory. Figures should be placed under `figures/`. Bibliography should be put into `library.bib`. If you have multiple and/or large tables I recommend creating a separate folder and individula files for them and importing them.

## Configuration
You should replace the configuration at the top of `thesis.tex` with your actual information. That's it!
