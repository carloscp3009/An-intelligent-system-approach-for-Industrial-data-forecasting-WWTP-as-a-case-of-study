Considering the exponential growth of today’s industry and the wastewater results of its processes, it needs to have an optimal treatment system for such effluent waters to mitigate the environmental impact generated by its discharges and comply with the environmental regulatory standards that are progressively increasing their demand. This leads to the need to innovate in the control and management information systems of the systems responsible to treat these residual waters in search of improvement. This paper proposes the development of an intelligent system that uses the data from the process and makes a prediction of its behavior to provide support in decision making related to the operation of the \ac{WWTP}. To carry out the development of this system, a multilayer perceptron neural network with 2 hidden layers and 22 neurons each is implemented, together with process variable analysis, time-series decomposition, correlation and autocorrelation techniques; it is possible to predict the chemical oxygen demand (COD) at the input of the bioreactor with a one-day window and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 10.8\%\, which places this work between the adequate ranges proposed in the literature.
 
 In recent years, the implementation and development of electronic measurement devices, data storage systems, management information systems, and the increase in computational processing capabilities have ushered in an improvement in industrial data availability, volume, and complexity. Transformation of data into information allows a better understanding, modelling, and optimization of industrial processes. This work aims to predict, with a 1-day time-window, some key variables in an Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) that assist in the decision-making process regard the operation of itself. Three different approaches: Feed-forward Neural Network (FFNN) with auto-regression, Long short-term Memory Neural network (LSTM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) predict the Chemical Oxygen Demand at discharge point (CODD), COD in the equalizer output (CODEQ), and Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids (MLVSS). Afterwards, three ensemble strategies combine the model’s output to enhance the prediction. Results show a comparison between the approaches’ performance and the ensembles’ proposals.
