The selection and characterization of the most significant variables of the wastewater treatment process have been carried out satisfactorily using correlation analysis, autocorrelations and decomposition of the time series. With these variables, an intelligent system based on artificial neural networks was developed to be capable of giving an adequate prediction of chemical oxygen demand, one of the most suitable variables to measure the level of pollutant load in the water and make decisions. The results show that the model presented a MAPE of 10.8\%, which supports its good performance according to historical data mentioned in [14], where the testing step ranged between 10\% and 13\%, predicting BOD, COD or TSS. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that this work presents as a novelty the use of time-series decomposition techniques to address the COD prediction and using an ANN, in comparison with the works presented in Section 2, whose summary can be seen in Table 2. This methodology can be useful to improve the prediction of some complex variables in which the ANNs do not have the desired performance. Finally, a platform was possible to design mainly to visualize available WWTP variables, monitor COD forecasting and consult the historical measurements. 

In search of constant improvement of the industrial wastewater treatment process, it is considered for future works to scale the prediction of the system to other key variables of the process, obtain a larger amount of data considering newly available measurements in the process and increase the scope of the prediction.
