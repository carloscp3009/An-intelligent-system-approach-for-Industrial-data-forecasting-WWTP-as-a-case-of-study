\section{Machine Learning}
\label{s:Second-Background-Topic}

\ac{ML} is an area of the \ac{AI} where a computer is programmed to learn form data \cite{Ray2019}. In 1959 Arthur Samuel defined the Machine Learning as \textbf{the field of study that gives the computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed}. Almost 40 years later, Tom Mitchell described Machine Learning as follows: \textbf{A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.} \autoref{f:AI} \cite{raza_cinquergrana_2018} shows the how the \ac{ML} fits in the \ac{AI} world and presents \ac{DL} as part of \ac{ML} which is presented in \autoref{s:Second-Background-Deep-Learning}.

Now a days machine Learning is used in a variety of fields such as: robotics, biology, social science, virtual personal assistants, computer games, autonomous driving, pattern recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, product recommendation, market prediction, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, agriculture advisory, Bots, climatology, social media services, among others \cite{Srivastava_2019, Shinde_2018, Ray2019}, \autoref{f:Ml-app} shows some of the \ac{ML} application domains. An important milestone was the transition from rule based programming to the learning based on data. \autoref{f:Traditional-approach} shows how the rule based approach works, where it is needed to start by studying the problem, identify some patterns and build a set of rules based on them. Later, the system is evaluated and the rules are adjusted until the performance is good enough \cite{geron2017}.
