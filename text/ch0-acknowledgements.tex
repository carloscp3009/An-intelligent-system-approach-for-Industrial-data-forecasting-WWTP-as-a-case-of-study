Itâ€™s been two years since I started this journey. It has been an interesting apprenticeship not only in the scientific and academic fields but in the professional and personal ones. Achieving this goal means a lot to me and I want to thank everyone that has supported and helped me during the process. However, there are a couple of individuals who deserve special mention.

Firstly, I would like to thank \textbf{God} for giving me the health, motivation and enlightenment to carry out this research. I want to thank \textbf{my family and friends} for their motivation and support during this difficult moments the world is going through.

I also want to thank my advisor \textbf{Dr.} \textbf{\myProfFirstName} \textbf{\myProfLastName} and my co-advisor \textbf{Professor} \textbf{\myOtherProfFirstName} \textbf{\myOtherProfLastName} for the trust, patience and guidance during this journey, and for their support of my research project application, without which my candidature would not have been possible. A special thanks goes to my dear friend and colleague \textbf{Ing. Luis Arismendy} who has support me along the way, constantly reviewing and giving me feedback to improve my work.

Furthermore, I want to acknowledge \textbf{Prof. Aymer Maturana} and \textbf{Ing.
