Itâ€™s been two years since I started this journey. It has been an exciting apprenticeship not only in the scientific and academic fields but in the professional and personal ones. Achieving this goal means a lot to me, and I want to thank everyone that has supported and helped me during the process. However, there are a couple of individuals who deserve special mention.

Firstly, I would like to thank \textbf{God} for giving me the health, motivation and enlightenment to conduct this research. I want to thank \textbf{my family and friends} for their encouragement and support during this challenging moment the world is going through.

I also want to thank my advisor \textbf{Dr.} \textbf{\myProfFirstName} \textbf{\myProfLastName}, and my co-advisor, \textbf{Professor} \textbf{\myOtherProfFirstName} \textbf{\myOtherProfLastName}, for their trust, patience, and guidance during this journey, and for their support of my research project application, without which my candidature would not have been possible. A special thanks go to my dear friend and colleague \textbf{Ing. Luis Arismendy}, who has supported me along the way, constantly reviewing and giving me feedback to improve my work.

Furthermore, I want to acknowledge \textbf{Prof. Aymer Maturana} and \textbf{Ing. Ricardo Marchena} for helping me understand the wastewater treatment conceptualization, which has been vital for the development of this study. I also want to thank all partners and Professors for the many discussions and valuable inputs during these years.
