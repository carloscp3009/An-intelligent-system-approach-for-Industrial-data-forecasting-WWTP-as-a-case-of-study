abstract = {Influent flow of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a crucial variable for plant operation and management. In this study, a random forest (RF) model was applied for daily wastewater inflow prediction, and a new probabilistic prediction approach was, for the first time, applied for quantifying the uncertainties associated with wastewater inflow prediction. The RF model uses regression trees to capture the nonlinear relationship between wastewater inflow and various influencing factors, such as weather features and domestic water usage patterns. The proposed model was applied to the daily wastewater inflow prediction for two WWTPs (i.e., Humber and one confidential plant) in Ontario, Canada. For the confidential WWTP, the coefficient of determination (R2) values for training and testing were 0.971 and 0.722, respectively. The R2 values at the Humber WWTP were 0.957 and 0.584 for training and testing, respectively. In comparison with other approaches such as the multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP) models and autoregressive integrated moving average models, the results show that the RF model performs well on predicting inflow. In addition, probabilistic prediction of daily inflow was generated. For the Humber station, 93.56\%\ of the total testing samples fall into its corresponding predicted interval. For the confidential plant, 78 observed values of the total 89 samples fall into its corresponding interval, accounting for 87.64\%\ of the total testing samples. The results show that the probabilistic approach can provide robust decision support for the operation, management, and optimization of WWTPs.},

A novel predicting model based on genetic-deep belief network algorithm was proposed to improve the predictive accuracy and reliability for process monitoring. Considering the deep belief networks (DBN) as a deep learning model is aiming to describe the relationship among variables in a complex process modeling, genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to reduce the input variables dimensionality, simplify the network structure and overcome the dynamic characteristic difficulties of process data in monitoring. Compared with DBN and back propagation neural network (BPNN), the GA-DBN effectively achieved a better predictive accuracy than other tests models in complex wastewater treatment processes. The value of the coefficient of determination of GA-DBN model is increased by 1.71–1.86\% and 5.21–9.32\%, respectively. The GA-DBN model can be structured with fewer variables or samples to describe the complex paper-making wastewater treatment process, obtaining the better model performance and predictive accuracy.},

abstract = {The measurement of the wastewater BOD5 level requires five days, and the use of a prediction model to estimate BOD5 saves time and enables the adoption of an online control system. This study investigates the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in predicting the influent BOD5 concentration and the performance of WWTPs. The WWTP performance was defined in terms of the COD, BOD, and TSS concentrations in the effluent. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the best-performing ANN network structure and configuration. The results showed that the ANN model developed to predict the BOD concentration performed the best among the three outputs. The topperforming ANN models yielded R2 values of 0.752, 0.612, and 0.631 for the prediction of the BOD, COD, and TSS concentrations, respectively. The optimal performing models were obtained (three inputs one output), which indicated that the influent temperature and conductivity greatly affect the WWTP performance as inputs in all models. The developed prediction model for the influent BOD5 concentration attained a high accuracy, i.e., R2=0.754, which implies that the model is viable as a soft sensor for online control and management systems for WWTPs. Overall, the ANN model provides a simple approach for the prediction of the complex processes of WWTPs.},

Model development focused on postulating an adaptive, functional, real-time and alternative approach for modeling the removal efficiency of Kjeldahl Nitrogen. The input variables used for modeling were daily time series data recorded at wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located in Mangalore during the period June 2014-September 2014. The performance of ANFIS model developed using Gbell and trapezoidal membership functions (MFs) and SVM are assessed using different statistical indices like root mean square error, correlation coefficients (CC) and Nash Sut-cliff error (NSE). The errors related to the prediction of effluent Kjeldahl Nitrogen concentration by the SVM modeling appeared to be reasonable when compared to that of ANFIS models with Gbell and trapezoidal MF. From the performance evaluation of the developed SVM model, it is observed that the approach is capable to define the interrelationship between various wastewater quality variables and thus SVM can be potentially applied for evaluating the efficiency of aerobic biological processes in WWTP.},

abstract = {Efficient management of Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs) can produce significant environmental and economic benefits. Energy benchmarking can be used to compare WWTPs, identify targets and use these to improve their performance. Different authors have performed benchmark analysis on monthly or yearly basis but their approaches suffer from a time lag between an event, its detection, interpretation and potential actions. The availability of on-line measurement data on many WWTPs should theoretically enable the decrease of the management response time by daily benchmarking. Unfortunately this approach is often impossible because of limited data availability. This paper proposes a methodology to perform a daily benchmark analysis under database limitations. The methodology has been applied to the Energy Online System (EOS) developed in the framework of the project "INNERS" (INNovative Energy Recovery Strategies in the urban water cycle). EOS calculates a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the evaluation of energy and process performances. In EOS, the energy KPIs take in consideration the pollutant load in order to enable the comparison between different plants. For example, EOS does not analyse the energy consumption but the energy consumption on pollutant load. This approach enables the comparison of performances for plants with different loads or for a single plant under different load conditions. The energy consumption is measured by on-line sensors, while the pollutant load is measured in the laboratory approximately every 14 days. Consequently, the unavailability of the water quality parameters is the limiting factor in calculating energy KPIs. In this paper, in order to overcome this limitation, the authors have developed a methodology to estimate the required parameters and manage the uncertainty in the estimation. By coupling the parameter estimation with an interval based benchmark approach, the authors propose an effective, fast and reproducible way to manage infrequent inlet measurements. Its use enables benchmarking on a daily basis and prepares the ground for further investigation.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of water quality parameters plays a crucial and decisive role in environmental monitoring, ecological systems sustainability, human health, aquaculture and improved agricultural practices. In this study a new hybrid two-layer decomposition model based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and the variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm coupled with extreme learning machines (ELM) and also least square support vector machine (LSSVM) was designed to support real-time environmental monitoring of water quality parameters, i.e. chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in a Lake reservoir. Daily measurements of Chl-a and DO for June 2012–May 2013 were employed where the partial autocorrelation function was applied to screen the relevant inputs for the model construction. The variables were then split into training, validation and testing subsets where the first stage of the model testing captured the superiority of the ELM over the LSSVM algorithm. To improve these standalone predictive models, a second stage implemented a two-layer decomposition with the model inputs decomposed in the form of high and low frequency oscillations, represented by the intrinsic mode function (IMF) through the CEEMDAN algorithm. The highest frequency component, IMF1 was further decomposed with the VMD algorithm to segregate key model input features, leading to a two-layer hybrid VMD-CEEMDAN model. The VMD-CEEMDAN-ELM model was able to reduce the root mean square and the mean absolute error by about 14.04% and 7.12% for the Chl-a estimation and about 5.33% and 4.30% for the DO estimation, respectively, compared with the standalone counterparts. Overall, the developed methodology demonstrates the robustness of the two-phase VMD-CEEMDAN-ELM model in identifying and analyzing critical water quality parameters with a limited set of model construction data over daily horizons, and thus, to actively support environmental monitoring tasks, especially in case of high-frequency, and relatively complex, real-time datasets.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that effective prediction of wastewater treatment results (WTR) is conducive to precise control of aeration amount in the wastewater treatment process (WTP). Conventional biochemical mechanism-driven approaches are highly dependent on complicated and redundant model parameters, resulting in low efficiency. Besides, sharp increase in business volume of wastewater treatment requires automatic operation technologies for this purpose. Under this background, researchers started to introduce the idea of data mining to model the WTP, in order to automatically predict WTR given inlet conditions and aeration amount. However, existing data-driven approaches for this purpose focus on modelling of the WTP at independent timestamps, neglecting sequential characteristics of timestamps during the long-term treatment process. To tackle the challenge, in this paper, a novel prediction and control framework through combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed for prediction of the WTR. Firstly, the CNN model is utilized to automatically extract the local features of each independent timestamp in the WTP and make them encoded. Next, the RNN model is employed to represent global sequential features of the WTP on the basis of local feature encoding. Finally, we conduct a large number of experiments to verify efficiency and stability of the proposed prediction framework.},

The influent wastewater characteristics, including, total organic contents, NH4-N, TN, TP, chemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, and operating parameters, such as dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, and mixed-liquor suspended solids, were considered as inputs, while removal efficiency was taken as an output parameter. First, data analysis and its normalization were conducted to improve the learning speed of the model. Performance criteria of the proposed model were evaluated based on statistical values, including the mean-square error (MSE) and root-mean-square error-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). Based on the goodness-of-fit values, the proposed LSTM model achieved good performance in the testing dataset; calculation results deviated little, indicated by the MSE values of 0.0047, 0.015, and 0.018 for NH4-N, TN, and TP, and RSR values of 0.0104, 0.129, and 0.141, respectively. The proposed LSTM model predicted the most precise removal efficiency for NH4-N of A-A-O MBR system, while TN and TP predictions were comparatively less accurate, but still acceptable. The proposed LSTM model is promising for predicting the nutrient removal efficiency of the A-A-O MBR system in real-time and can aid in establishing process control strategies. Therefore, the proposed LSTM model is an adequate interpolation tool to predict the nutrient removal efficiency of the A-A-O MBR process in wastewater treatment systems.},

Six different batches of sequence batch reactor (SBR) effluent from a paper mill were treated with PEC oxidation for 90 minutes, and 546 data points were collected from the on-line measurements of ORP, DO and pH, and the off-line COD analysis.

However, the load of food waste to the conventional waste treatment process might lead to the high concentration of total nitrogen (T-N) impact on the effluent water quality. The objective of this study is to establish two machine learning models-artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), in order to predict 1-day interval T-N concentration of effluent from a wastewater treatment plant in Ulsan, Korea. Daily water quality data and meteorological data were used and the performance of both models was evaluated in terms of the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), relative efficiency criteria (d<inf>rel</inf>). Additionally, Latin-Hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) and a pattern search algorithm were applied to sensitivity analysis and model parameter optimization, respectively. Results showed that both models could be effectively applied to the 1-day interval prediction of T-N concentration of effluent. SVM model showed a higher prediction accuracy in the training stage and similar result in the validation stage. However, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ANN model was a superior model for 1-day interval T-N concentration prediction in terms of the cause-and-effect relationship between T-N concentration and modeling input values to integrated food waste and waste water treatment.

The data records in this study were measured between June 2015 and May 2016 and obtained from the laboratory of Antalya Hurma WWTP. In the creation of the model, classical regression analysis, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), artificial bee colony, and teaching-learning based optimization were used. The root mean square error and the mean absolute error were used to evaluate performance criteria for each model. When the results of the analyses were compared with each other, it was observed that the MARS method gave better estimation results than the other methods used in the study. As a result, it was evinced that the MARS method produces acceptable results in the BOD estimation.},

abstract = {Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids (TDS) and total suspended solids (TSS) are the most commonly regulated wastewater effluent parameters. The measurement and prediction of these parameters are essential for assessing the performance and upgrade of wastewater treatment facilities. In this study, a new methodology, combining a linear stochastic model (ARIMA) and nonlinear outlier robust extreme learning machine technique (ORELM) with various preprocesses, is presented to model the quality parameters of effluent wastewater (ARIMA-ORELM). For each of the studied parameters, 144 different (144 × 8 models) linear models (ARIMA) are presented, with the superior model of each parameter being selected based on statistical indices. Moreover, 48 nonlinear models (ORELM) and 48 hybrid models (ARIMA-ORELM) were considered. The use of linear and nonlinear approaches to model the linear and nonlinear terms (respectively) of each time series in the hybrid model increased the efficiency and accuracy of the predictions for all of the time series. The influent wastewater nonlinear TSS model and the effluent COD and BOD models attained the best performance with a high correlation coefficient of 0.95. The use of hybrid models improved the prediction capability of all quality parameters with the best performance being achieved for the effluent BOD model (R 2 = 0.99).},

abstract = {Due to different sources and the water using habits, the influent COD of municipal sewage fluctuates sharply over time. To ensure the treatment quality of sewage, the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) often over-aerate the air and over-add the chemicals. This results in a waste of energy consumption and increases the operation cost for WWTP. With the rapid expansion of industrialization and urbanization, the quantity of municipal sewage has increased by years. Energy saving and sustainable water management for municipal WWTP are becoming an urgent issue that needs to be solved. This paper proposes a COD load forecasting model for municipal WWTP using hybrid artificial intelligence algorithms. The auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) algorithm is used for sewage inflow forecasting, and the vector auto-regression (VAR) algorithm is used for COD forecasting. The real-time data from a municipal WWTP is collected for model verification. Besides the proposed ARMA + VAR model, the BPNN, LSSVM, and GA-BPNN based COD load forecasting models are also studied as the contrasting cases. The accuracy of the forecasting performance of the ARMA + VAR model is as high as nearly 99%, which reveals its superior to the other forecasting models for future application in the wastewater treatment plants.},

abstract = {Water resources are the foundation of people's life and economic development, and are closely related to health and the environment. Accurate prediction of water quality is the key to improving water management and pollution control. In this paper, two novel hybrid decision tree-based machine learning models are proposed to obtain more accurate short-term water quality prediction results. The basic models of the two hybrid models are extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF), which respectively introduce an advanced data denoising technique - complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). Taking the water resources of Gales Creek site in Tualatin River (one of the most polluted rivers in the world) Basin as an example, a total of 1875 data (hourly data) from May 1, 2019 to July 20, 2019 are collected. Two hybrid models are used to predict six water quality indicators, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH value, specific conductance, turbidity, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter. Six error metrics are introduced as the basis of performance evaluation, and the results of the two models are compared with the other four conventional models. The results reveal that: (1) CEEMDAN-RF performs best in the prediction of temperature, dissolved oxygen and specific conductance, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are 0.69%, 1.05%, and 0.90%, respectively. CEEMDAN-XGBoost performs best in the prediction of pH value, turbidity, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter, the MAPEs are 0.27%, 14.94%, and 1.59%, respectively. (2) The average MAPEs of CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMMDAN-XGBoost models are the smallest, which are 3.90% and 3.71% respectively, indicating that their overall prediction performance is the best. In addition, the stability of the prediction model is also discussed in this paper. The analysis shows that the prediction stability of CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMDAN-XGBoost is higher than other benchmark models.},

These ranges are typically observed throughout the year at CETP, Ahmedabad, India. The percentage mean accuracy for mechanistic model was 88 %. The difference between predicted and actual measured values of RMSE and percentage mean accuracy of mechanistic model is acceptable as system is highly sensitive.

abstract = {In this work, a statistical stability metric and novel hybrid statistical-machine learning ammonia forecasting model are developed to improve the accuracy and precision of municipal wastewater treatment. Aeration for biological nutrient removal is typically the largest energy expense for municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Ammonia-based aeration control (ABAC) is one approach designed to minimize excessive aeration by adjusting air blower output from online ammonia measurements rather than from a dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor, which is the conventional aeration control approach. We propose a quantitative stability metric, Total Sample Variance, to compare system-wide variability of competing aeration control strategies. Using this metric, the performance of traditional DO and ABAC control strategies with varying setpoints and control parameters were compared in a medium-sized WWTP, and the most stable strategy was identified and implemented at the facility. To further improve ABAC performance, ammonia forecasting models were constructed using both statistical and machine learning to improve the accuracy of the aeration control system. Diurnal, diurnal-linear, artificial neural network (ANN), and hybrid diurnal-linear-ANN forecasting models were trained on real-time plant-wide process data. The diurnal-linear and diurnal-linear-ANN forecasts were found to most accurately forecast ammonia; improving upon the existing ammonia measurement by up to 32% and 46%, respectively, whereas the ANN model forecast was only able to improve by up to 8%. This work demonstrates the ease and flexibility of integrating statistics and machine learning methods for developing new treatment models in conventional WWTP for features in full-scale conventional activated sludge systems.},

To achieve better prediction and control of effluent TN concentration, an efficient prediction model, based on controllable operation parameters, was constructed in a sequencing batch reactor process. Compared with previous models, this model has two main characteristics: ① Superficial gas velocity and anoxic time are controllable operation parameters and are selected as the main input parameters instead of dissolved oxygen to improve the model controllability, and ② the model prediction accuracy is improved on the basis of a feedforward neural network (FFNN) with algorithm optimization. The results demonstrated that the FFNN model was efficiently optimized by scaled conjugate gradient, and the performance was excellent compared with other models in terms of the correlation coefficient (R). The optimized FFNN model could provide an accurate prediction of effluent TN based on influent water parameters and key control parameters. This study revealed the possible application of the optimized FFNN model for the efficient removal of pollutants and lower energy consumption at most of the WWTPs.},

A time lag coefficient is introduced and a kernel function is embedded into the extreme learning machine (ELM) to extract dynamic information and obtain better prediction accuracy. A case study for modeling a wastewater treatment process is demonstrated to evaluate the performance of the proposed DKELM.

abstract = {Producing reclaimed water meeting water quality standards for agricultural and industrial demands is a viable option to the Tabriz area, East Azerbaijan, Iran, due to water scarcity. This study focuses on the Tabriz wastewater treatment plant (TWWTP) and investigates its treatability. This research proposes an ensemble of fuzzy logic (FL) models as surrogates for the TWWTP to avoid simulating complex physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes. Each FL model predicts water quality parameters of TWWTP using measured influent water quality data, such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, temperature, and total suspended solids. Instead of looking for the best FL forecasting model, this study introduces a supervised committee FL (SCFL) model as a predictive ensemble model for effluent water quality. The SCFL model uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to combine forecasted water quality results from individual FL models. Three FL models of Takagi-Sugeno, Mamdani, and Larsen are the surrogates for TWWTP. Compared to the historical data on effluent water quality, the individual FL models have a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for BOD, COD and TSS in the testing step ranging between 10% and 13%. Using the CFL model, the MAPE in the testing step reduces to 5%–7%. The SCFL model further reduces MAPE to 4% in the testing step. The SCFL model is an alternative to predict the quality of effluent water parameters by performing better than the individual FL and CFL models for the Wastewater Treatment Plant.},

The purpose of this paper is to apply an artificial neural network (ANN) approach with a feed-forward back-propagation in order to predict the ten-month performance of Touggourt WWTP in terms of effluent Chemical Oxygen Demand (CODeff). Design/methodology/approach: The inﬂuent variables such as (pHinf), temperature (TEinf), suspended solid (SSinf), Kjeldahl Nitrogen (KNinf), biochemical oxygen demand (BODinf) and chemical oxygen demand (CODinf) were used as input variables of neural networks. To determine the appropriate architecture of the neural network models, several steps of training were conducted, namely the validation and testing of the models by varying the number of neurons and activation functions in the hidden layer, the activation function in output layer as well as the learning algorithms. Findings: The better results were achieved with an architecture network [6-50-1], hyperbolic tangent sigmoid activation functions at hidden layer, linear activation functions at output layer and a Levenberg – Marquardt method as learning algorithm. The results showed that the ANN model could predict the experimental results with high correlation coefficient 0.89, 0.96 and 0.87 during learning, validation and testing phases, respectively. The overall results indicated that the ANN modeling approach can provide an effective tool for simulating, controlling and predicting the performance of WWTP. Originality/value: This work is the first of its kind in this region due to the remarkable development in terms of population and agricultural activity in the region, which drove to the increase of water pollutants, so it is necessary to use the modern technologies to modeling and controlling of WWTP.},

In this way, a reliable predictive model is a necessity to achieve an acceptable performance. This study represents a novel approach to predict the effluent quality parameters for an industrial wastewater treatment plant in Qom province, Iran. Three new ensemble machine learning models called Ada Boost Regression (ABR), Gradient Boost Regression (GBR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) are used to predict the effluent quality parameters including Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), five-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) in daily scale. The gamma test technique is used to obtain the optimistic predictive variables. The performance accuracy of the predictive models is assessed based on several metrics indices and visual performance indicators. Results show that the ABR model provides the most performance for predicting the TDS ([Formula presented]) while the GBR offers a better accuracy to simulate the BOD5 ([Formula presented]) and COD ([Formula presented]) parameters.

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe the state-of-the art computer-based techniques for data analysis to improve operation of wastewater treatment plants. A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed papers shows that European researchers have led academic computer-based method development during the last two decades. The most cited techniques are artificial neural networks, principal component analysis, fuzzy logic, clustering, independent component analysis and partial least squares regression. Even though there has been progress on techniques related to the development of environmental decision support systems, knowledge discovery and management, the research sector is still far from delivering systems that smoothly integrate several types of knowledge and different methods of reasoning. Several limitations that currently prevent the application of computer-based techniques in practice are highlighted.},

abstract = {Considering the exponential growth of today's industry and the wastewater results of its processes, it needs to have an optimal treatment system for such effluent waters to mitigate the environmental impact generated by its discharges and comply with the environmental regulatory standards that are progressively increasing their demand. This leads to the need to innovate in the control and management information systems of the systems responsible to treat these residual waters in search of improvement. This paper proposes the development of an intelligent system that uses the data from the process and makes a prediction of its behavior to provide support in decision making related to the operation of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). To carry out the development of this system, a multilayer perceptron neural network with 2 hidden layers and 22 neurons each is implemented, together with process variable analysis, time-series decomposition, correlation and autocorrelation techniques; it is possible to predict the chemical oxygen demand (COD) at the input of the bioreactor with a one-day window and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 10.8%, which places this work between the adequate ranges proposed in the literature.},

abstract = {In the present study, three different artificial intelligence based non-linear models, i.e. feed forward neural network (FFNN), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM) approaches and a classical multi-linear regression (MLR) method were applied for predicting the performance of Nicosia wastewater treatment plant (NWWTP), in terms of effluent biological oxygen demand (BOD eff ), chemical oxygen demand (COD eff ) and total nitrogen (TN eff ). The daily data were used to develop single and ensemble models to improve the prediction ability of the methods. The obtained results of single models proved that, ANFIS model provides effective outcomes in comparison with single models. In the ensemble modeling, simple averaging ensemble, weighted averaging ensemble and neural network ensemble techniques were proposed subsequently to improve the performance of the single models. The results showed that in prediction of BOD eff , the ensemble models of simple averaging ensemble (SAE), weighted averaging ensemble (WAE) and neural network ensemble (NNE), increased the performance efficiency of artificial intelligence (AI) modeling up to 14%, 20% and 24% at verification phase, respectively, and less than or equal to 5% for both COD eff and TN eff in calibration phase. This shows that NNE model is more robust and reliable ensemble method for predicting the NWWTP performance due to its non-linear averaging kernel.},

In addition, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) linear model was used to predict BODeff and CODeff parameters in order to compare the linear and non-linear models abilities in complex processes prediction. To improve the prediction of BODeff and CODeff parameters, the data post-processing ensemble method and the jittering data pre-processing method were also used. The input data set included daily influent BOD, COD, total suspended solids (TSS), pH at the current time (t) and BODeff and CODeff at the previous time (t-1), also, the output data included BODeff and CODeff at t. The results of the single models indicated that SVR model provides better results than the other single models. To create jittered series, different levels of noise series were added to the original time series to produce more time series with similar patterns to the original time series to extend the scale of the training data set. In the ensemble modeling, simple and weighted linear averaging, and neural network ensemble methods were applied to enhance the performance of the single AI models. The results indicated that using jittering and ensemble models could increase the prediction accuracy up to 20% at the verification phase.},

abstract = {Producing reclaimed water meeting water quality standards for agricultural and industrial demands is a viable option to the Tabriz area, East Azerbaijan, Iran, due to water scarcity. This study focuses on the Tabriz wastewater treatment plant (TWWTP) and investigates its treatability. This research proposes an ensemble of fuzzy logic (FL) models as surrogates for the TWWTP to avoid simulating complex physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes. Each FL model predicts water quality parameters of TWWTP using measured influent water quality data, such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, temperature, and total suspended solids. Instead of looking for the best FL forecasting model, this study introduces a supervised committee FL (SCFL) model as a predictive ensemble model for effluent water quality. The SCFL model uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to combine forecasted water quality results from individual FL models. Three FL models of Takagi-Sugeno, Mamdani, and Larsen are the surrogates for TWWTP. Compared to the historical data on effluent water quality, the individual FL models have a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for BOD, COD and TSS in the testing step ranging between 10% and 13%. Using the CFL model, the MAPE in the testing step reduces to 5%–7%. The SCFL model further reduces MAPE to 4% in the testing step. The SCFL model is an alternative to predict the quality of effluent water parameters by performing better than the individual FL and CFL models for the Wastewater Treatment Plant.},

abstract = {Reliable performance evaluation of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can be done by simulating the plant behavior over a wide range of influent disturbances, including series of rain events with different intensity and duration, seasonal temperature variations, holiday effects, etc. Such simulation-based WWTP performance evaluations are in practice limited by the long simulation time of the mechanistic WWTP models. By moderate simplification (avoiding big losses in prediction accuracy) of the mechanistic WWTP model only a limited reduction of the simulation time can be achieved. The approach proposed in this paper combines an influent disturbance generator with a mechanistic WWTP model for generating a limited sequence of training data (4 months of dynamic data). An artificial neural network (ANN) is then trained on the available WWTP input-output data, and is subsequently used to simulate the remainder of the influent time series (20 years of dynamic data) generated with the influent disturbance generator. It is demonstrated that the ANN reduces simulation time by a factor of 36, even when including the time needed for the generation of training data and for ANN training. For repeated integrated urban wastewater system simulations that do not require repeated training of the ANN, the ANN reduces simulation time by a factor of 1300 compared to the mechanistic model. ANN prediction of effluent ammonium, BOD5 and total suspended solids was good when compared to mechanistic WWTP model predictions, whereas prediction of effluent COD and total nitrogen concentrations was a bit less satisfactory. With correlation coefficients R2 > 0.95 and prediction errors lower than 10%, the accuracy of the ANN is sufficient for applications in simulation-based WWTP design and simulation of integrated urban wastewater systems, especially when taking into account the uncertainties related to mechanistic WWTP modeling. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most of the existing methods have difficulty in obtaining the real-time values of some key variables in the process. In order to handle this issue, a data-driven intelligent monitoring system, using the soft sensor technique and data distribution service, is developed to monitor the concentrations of effluent total phosphorous (TP) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N). In this intelligent monitoring system, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is applied for designing the soft sensor model, and a principal component analysis (PCA) method is used to select the input variables of the soft sensor model. Moreover, data transfer software is exploited to insert the soft sensor technique to the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. Finally, this proposed intelligent monitoring system is tested in several real plants to demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the monitoring performance.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in data-driven process control and performance analysis could provide the wastewater treatment industry with an opportunity to reduce costs and improve operations. However, big data in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is widely underutilized, due in part to a workforce that lacks background knowledge of data science required to fully analyze the unique characteristics of WWTP. Wastewater treatment processes exhibit nonlinear, nonstationary, autocorrelated, and co-correlated behavior that (i) is very difficult to model using first principals and (ii) must be considered when implementing data-driven methods. This review provides an overview of data-driven methods of achieving fault detection, variable prediction, and advanced control of WWTP. We present how big data has been used in the context of WWTP, and much of the discussion can also be applied to water treatment. Due to the assumptions inherent in different data-driven modeling approaches (e.g., control charts, statistical process control, model predictive control, neural networks, transfer functions, fuzzy logic), not all methods are appropriate for every goal or every dataset. Practical guidance is given for matching a desired goal with a particular methodology along with considerations regarding the assumed data structure. References for further reading are provided, and an overall analysis framework is presented.},

abstract = {Several potential problems associated with emissions such as odour nuisance may occur in sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Improved understanding of prediction of emitted gases (e.g. hydrogen sulphide, H2S) is of great importance for better evaluation of such problems in WWTPs. The present paper provides a survey of the feasibility of utilising soft computing models in predicting emission factors (gaseous H2S) of based on five input parameters including the total dissolved sulphides, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), temperature, flow rate and pH. Multivariate nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) neural networks were developed and applied to predict weekly H2S in four WWTPS. Due to the nonlinearity nature of the H2S emission, the principle component analysis, and the average mutual information (AMI) method was employed to determine the effective independent parameters and the optimal time lags in state space for the H2S data. In addition to the NARX models, three standard regressive models (multiple linear regression model, stepwise regression and two-variate logarithmic regression model) were also applied to the same dataset for evaluating the capability and reliability of the developed NARX models. Based on several statistical measures (RMSE, MAPE, PCC, NSE & GRI), it was found that the NARX models were superior to the other applied models in predicting emitted H2S. Although the temperature and wastewater flow rate were found to be the most effective parameters for modelling H2S, but the results indeed showed that taking into account of all wastewater parameters would lead to more accurate H2S prediction.},

An optimized extreme learning machine (ELM) based on an improved cuckoo search algorithm (ICS) is proposed in this paper for the design of soft BOD measurement model. In ICS-ELM, the input weights matrices of the extreme learning machine and the threshold of the hidden layer are encoded as the cuckoo's nest locations. The best input weights matrices and threshold are obtained by using the strong global search ability of improved cuckoo search algorithm. The optimal results can be used to improve the precision of forecasting based on less number of neurons of the hidden layer in ELM. Simulation results show that the soft sensor model has good real-time performance, high prediction accuracy, and stronger generalization performance for BOD measurement of the effluent quality compared to other modeling methods such as back propagation (BP) network in most cases.},

abstract = {The assembling of bacterial communities in conventional activated sludge (CAS) bioreactors was thought, until recently, to be chaotic and mostly unpredictable. Studies done over the last decade have shown that specific, and often, predictable random and non-random factors could be responsible for that process. These studies have also motivated a "structure-function" paradigm that is yet to be resolved. Thus, elucidating the factors that affect community assembly in the bioreactors is necessary for predicting fluctuations in community structure and function. For this study activated sludge samples were collected during a one-year period from two geographically distant CAS bioreactors of different size. Combining community fingerprinting analysis and operational parameters data with a robust statistical analysis, we aimed to identify relevant links between system performance and bacterial community diversity and dynamics. In addition to revealing a significant $\beta$-diversity between the bioreactors' communities, results showed that the largest bioreactor had a less dynamic but more efficient and diverse bacterial community throughout the study. The statistical analysis also suggests that deterministic factors, as opposed to stochastic factors, may have a bigger impact on the community structure in the largest bioreactor. Furthermore, the community seems to rely mainly on mechanisms of resistance and functional redundancy to maintain functional stability. We suggest that the ecological theories behind the Island Biogeography model and the species-area relationship were appropriate to predict the assembly of bacterial communities in these CAS bioreactors. These results are of great importance for engineers and ecologists as they reveal critical aspects of CAS systems that could be applied towards improving bioreactor design and operation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Valentin-Vargas et al.},

abstract = {The water utility sector is subject to stringent legislation, seeking to address both the evolution of practices within the chemical/pharmaceutical industry, and the safeguarding of environmental protection, and which is informed by stakeholder views. Growing public environmental awareness is balanced by fair apportionment of liability within-sector. This highly complex and dynamic context poses challenges for water utilities seeking to manage the diverse chemicals arising from disparate sources reachingWastewater Treatment Plants, including residential, commercial, and industrial points of origin, and diffuse sources including agricultural and hard surface water run-off. Effluents contain broad ranges of organic and inorganic compounds, herbicides, pesticides, phosphorus, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals of emerging concern. These potential pollutants can be in dissolved form, or arise in association with organic matter, the associated risks posing significant environmental challenges. This paper examines how the adoption of new Big Data tools and computational technologies can offer great advantage to the water utility sector in addressing this challenge. Big Data approaches facilitate improved understanding and insight of these challenges, by industry, regulator, and public alike. We discuss how Big Data approaches can be used to improve the outputs of tools currently in use by the water industry, such as SAGIS (Source Apportionment GIS system), helping to reveal new relationships between chemicals, the environment, and human health, and in turn provide better understanding of contaminants in wastewater (origin, pathways, and persistence). We highlight how the sector can draw upon Big Data tools to add value to legacy datasets, such as the Chemicals Investigation Programme in the UK, combined with contemporary data sources, extending the lifespan of data, focusing monitoring strategies, and helping users adapt and plan more efficiently. Despite the relative maturity of the Big Data technology and adoption in many wider sectors, uptake within the water utility sector remains limited to date. By contrast with the extensive range of applications of Big Data in in other sectors, highlight is drawn to how improvements are required to achieve the full potential of this technology in the water utility industry.},

abstract = {To enhance energy production from methane or resource recovery from digestate, anaerobic digestion processes require advanced instrumentation and control tools. Over the years, research on these topics has evolved and followed the main fields of application of anaerobic digestion processes: from municipal sewage sludge to liquid—mainly industrial—then municipal organic fraction of solid waste and agricultural residues. Time constants of the processes have also changed with respect to the treated waste from minutes or hours to weeks or months. Since fast closed loop control is needed for short time constant processes, human operator is now included in the loop when taking decisions to optimize anaerobic digestion plants dealing with complex solid waste over a long retention time. Control objectives have also moved from the regulation of key variables—measured on-line—to the prediction of overall process performance—based on global off-line measurements—to optimize the feeding of the processes. Additionally, the need for more accurate prediction of methane production and organic matter biodegradation has impacted the complexity of instrumentation and should include a more detailed characterization of the waste (e.g., biochemical fractions like proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) and their bioaccessibility and biodegradability characteristics. However, even if in the literature several methodologies have been developed to determine biodegradability based on organic matter characterization, only a few papers deal with bioaccessibility assessment. In this review, we emphasize the high potential of some promising techniques, such as spectral analysis, and we discuss issues that could appear in the near future concerning control of AD processes.},

More recently, root cause analysis and diagnosis gained importance and a variety of approaches were proposed to expand IPM with this new and important monitoring dimension. We believe that, in the future, the emphasis will be to bring yet another dimension to IPM: prognosis.

abstract = {The first industrial revolution consisted in the mechanization that exploited the power of water and steam; the second came in the nineteenth century with mass production (Fordism); the third with the development of computers and their automation. Currently, we live in the era of so-called Industry 4.0, as has been named after the German scientists Kagermann, Lukas and Whalster. The development of Industry 4.0 is ascribable to the exploitation of information technology - through interconnection, collaboration and data analysis. These are all factors that depend on a fundamental element: information, which derives from the Latin noun "informatio (-nis)". The ability to analyse and identify (and interpret) information interconnections, through the progressive introduction of new technologies, will change (and in part is already changing) the production's methods: with the increase in integration between the various phases of production and client assistance, there will also be greater direct collaboration between the relevant actors. Big Data, in particular, allow us to investigate the smallest details and at the same time to identify large-scale correlations, so far unknown, with an infinite potential: most of the industrial companies, aware of the potential inherent in these processes, have already started to digitalise their production, their logistic and commercial procedures. Spontaneous questions then arise: where information is actually found, who owns it (which is not indifferent from the point of view of privacy matters), what potential economic exploitation are available. Two themes will be fundamental. The first concerns the so-called "end of work": increasingly sophisticated machines and robots that work, human workers who lose their jobs and income. The second concerns new legislative rules necessary to regulate robots' work and consequent algorithms that guide them: what happens if an intelligent robot causes damages? Whose responsibility is it? What can we say about security and privacy? The subject is so warm and sensitive that recently the European Parliament has proposed rules on civil law on robotics to the European Commission and further analysis is needed.},

However, the load of food waste to the conventional waste treatment process might lead to the high concentration of total nitrogen (T-N) impact on the effluent water quality. The objective of this study is to establish two machine learning models-artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), in order to predict 1-day interval T-N concentration of effluent from a wastewater treatment plant in Ulsan, Korea. Daily water quality data and meteorological data were used and the performance of both models was evaluated in terms of the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), relative efficiency criteria (d<inf>rel</inf>). Additionally, Latin-Hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) and a pattern search algorithm were applied to sensitivity analysis and model parameter optimization, respectively. Results showed that both models could be effectively applied to the 1-day interval prediction of T-N concentration of effluent. SVM model showed a higher prediction accuracy in the training stage and similar result in the validation stage. However, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ANN model was a superior model for 1-day interval T-N concentration prediction in terms of the cause-and-effect relationship between T-N concentration and modeling input values to integrated food waste and waste water treatment.

At present, predicting the effluent quality of wastewater treatment systems is difficult because of complex biological reaction mechanisms that vary with both time and the physical attributes of the system. Bayesian networks are useful for addressing uncertainties in artificial intelligence applications. Their powerful inferential capability and convenient decision support mechanisms provide flexibility and applicability for describing and analyzing factors affecting wastewater treatment systems. In this study, a Bayesian network-based approach for modeling and predicting a wastewater treatment system based on Modified Sequencing Batch Reactor (MSBR) was proposed. Using the presented approach, a Bayesian network model for MSBR can be constructed using experiential information and physical data relating to influent loads, operating conditions, and effluent concentrations. Additionally, MSBR prediction analysis, wherein effluent concentration can be predicted from influent loads and operational conditions, can be performed. This approach can be applied, with minimal modifications, to other types of wastewater treatment plants. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The main goal of this paper is to study how machine learning models can fit this reliability estimation function in comparison with traditional approaches (e.g., Weibull distribution). We use a supervised machine learning approach to predict this reliability in 19 industrial components obtained from real industries. Particularly, four diverse machine learning approaches are implemented: artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forest, and soft computing methods. We evaluate if there is one approach that outperforms the others when predicting the reliability of all the components, analyze if machine learning models improve their performance in the presence of censored data, and finally, understand the performance impact when the number of available inputs changes. Our experimental results show the high ability of machine learning to predict the component reliability and particularly, random forest, which generally obtains high accuracy and the best results for all the cases. Experimentation confirms that all the models improve their performance when considering censored data. Finally, we show how machine learning models obtain better prediction results with respect to traditional methods when increasing the size of the time-to-failure datasets.},

To optimize the control strategies of the AAO system under varying influent loads, Q matrixes were built for both HRTs and IRR optimization through the pair of < max reward-action> based on the integrated ASM2d-QL algorithm. 8 days of actual influent qualities of a certain municipal AAO wastewater treatment plant in June were arbitrarily chosen as the influent concentrations for model verification. Good agreement between the values of the model simulations and experimental results indicated that this proposed integrated ASM2d-QL algorithm performed properly and successfully realized intelligent modeling and stable optimal control strategies under fluctuating influent loads during wastewater treatment.},

Emphasis is given to an extensive overview of the current status and to the specific challenges and potential that allow for an effective application of these soft-sensors in full-scale scenarios. The soft-sensors presented in the case studies have been found to be effective and inexpensive technologies for extracting and modelling relevant process information directly from the process and laboratory data routinely acquired in biological wastewater treatment facilities. The extracted information is in the form of timely analysis of hard-to-measure primary process variables and process diagnostics that characterize the operation of the plants and their instrumentation.

abstract = {Control of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is challenging not only because of their high nonlinearity but also because of important external perturbations. One the most relevant of these perturbations is weather. In fact, different weather conditions imply different inflow rates and substance (e.g., N-ammonia, which is among the most important) concentrations. Therefore, weather has traditionally been an important signal that operators take into account to tune WWTP control systems. This signal cannot be directly measured with traditional physical sensors. Nevertheless, machine learning-based soft-sensors can be used to predict non-observable measures by means of available data. In this paper, we present novel research about a new soft-sensor that predicts the current weather signal. This weather prediction differs from traditional weather forecasting since this soft-sensor predicts the weather conditions as an operator does when controling the WWTP. This prediction uses a model based on past WWTP influent states measured by only a few physical and widely applied sensors. The results are encouraging, as we obtained a good accuracy level for a relevant and very useful signal when applied to advanced WWTP control systems.},

abstract = {Treatment of industrial wastewaters is currently confronting important challenges concerning both cost management of treatment plants and fulfillment of tightening environmental regulations. Online monitoring of wastewater treatment is critical, because changes in the performance of treatment can lead to various problems such as decreased efficiency of purification, decreased energy efficiency, or ineffective use of chemicals. Moreover, changes in the operation of a treatment process can inflict changes that have unforeseen consequences, including an increased amount of harmful effluents, and therefore it is essential for a monitoring system to be able to adapt to various process conditions. It seems, however, that the monitoring systems used currently by the industry are lacking this functionality and are therefore only partially able to meet the needs of modern industry. In addition, there is typically a large amount of measurement data available in the industry, for which advanced data processing and computational tools are needed for monitoring, analysis, and control. For this reason, it would be useful to have a monitoring system which could be able to handle a large amount of measurement data and present the essential information on the state and evolution of the process in a simple, user-friendly and flexible manner. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive multivariable approach based on self-organizing maps (SOM) which can be utilized for advanced monitoring of industrial processes. The system developed can provide a new kind of tool for illustrating the condition and evolution of an industrial wastewater treatment process. The operation of the system is demonstrated using process measurements from an activated sludge treatment plant, which is a part of a pulp and paper plant. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are sustainable solutions to water scarcity. As initial conditions offered to WWTPs, influent conditions (ICs) affect treatment units states, ongoing processes mechanisms, and product qualities. Anomalies in ICs, often raised by abnormal events, need to be monitored and detected promptly to improve system resilience and provide smart environments. This paper proposed and verified data-driven anomaly detection approaches based on deep learning methods and clustering algorithms. Combining both the ability to capture temporal auto-correlation features among multivariate time series from recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and the function to delineate complex distributions from restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), RNN-RBM models were employed and connected with various classifiers for anomaly detection. The effectiveness of RNN based, RBM based, RNN-RBM based, or standalone individual detectors, including expectation maximization clustering, K-means clustering, mean-shift clustering, one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), spectral clustering, and agglomerative clustering algorithms were evaluated by importing seven years ICs data from a coastal municipal WWTP where more than 150 abnormal events occurred. Results demonstrated that RNN-RBM-based OCSVM approach outperformed all other scenarios with an area under the curve value up to 0.98, which validated the superiority in feature extraction by RNN-RBM, and the robustness in multivariate nonlinear kernels by OCSVM. The model was flexible for not requiring assumptions on data distribution, and could be shared and transferred among environmental data scientists.},

In this context, new models are proposed to better face this problem, and, among them, artificial neural networks are emerging as effective. A first approach to these networks can be complex, but in this paper, we will show that even simple networks can approximate the cumulative failure distribution well. The neural network approach results are often better than those based on the most useful probability distribution in reliability, the Weibull. In this paper, the performances of multilayer feedforward basic networks with different network configurations are tested, changing different parameters (e.g., the number of nodes, the learning rate, and the momentum). We used a set of different failure data of components taken from the real world, and we analyzed the accuracy of the approximation of the different neural networks compared with the least squares method based on the Weibull distribution. The results show that the networks can satisfactorily approximate the cumulative failure distribution, very often better than the least squares method, particularly in cases with a small number of available failure times.},

abstract = {Prediction of sludge bulking is a matter of growing importance around the world. Sludge volume index (SVI) should be monitored to predict sludge bulking for a wastewater treatment plant. This study was an effort to develop hybrid artificial neural network-genetic algorithm models (MLPANN-GA and RBFANN-GA) to accurately predict SVI. Operating parameters, including MLVSS, pH, DO, temperature, TSS, COD and total nitrogen were the inputs of neural networks. Genetic algorithm was utilized in order to optimize weights and thresholds of the MLPANN and RFBANN models. Training procedures for SVI estimation were successful for both the MLPANN-GA and RBFANN-GA models. The training and validation models showed an almost perfect match between experimental and predicted values of SVI. The results indicated that with low experimental values of input data to train ANNs, the MLPANN-GA compared with the RBFANN-GA is more accurate due to higher coefficient of determination (R2) and lower root mean squared error (RMSE) values. The values of RMSE and R2 for the optimal models approached 0 and 1, respectively. The mean average error for the ANN models did not exceed 3% of the input values of the measured SVI. The GA increased the accuracy of all the MLPANN and RBFANN models.},

abstract = {In the present study, three different artificial intelligence based non-linear models, i.e. feed forward neural network (FFNN), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM) approaches and a classical multi-linear regression (MLR) method were applied for predicting the performance of Nicosia wastewater treatment plant (NWWTP), in terms of effluent biological oxygen demand (BOD eff ), chemical oxygen demand (COD eff ) and total nitrogen (TN eff ). The daily data were used to develop single and ensemble models to improve the prediction ability of the methods. The obtained results of single models proved that, ANFIS model provides effective outcomes in comparison with single models. In the ensemble modeling, simple averaging ensemble, weighted averaging ensemble and neural network ensemble techniques were proposed subsequently to improve the performance of the single models. The results showed that in prediction of BOD eff , the ensemble models of simple averaging ensemble (SAE), weighted averaging ensemble (WAE) and neural network ensemble (NNE), increased the performance efficiency of artificial intelligence (AI) modeling up to 14%, 20% and 24% at verification phase, respectively, and less than or equal to 5% for both COD eff and TN eff in calibration phase. This shows that NNE model is more robust and reliable ensemble method for predicting the NWWTP performance due to its non-linear averaging kernel.},

Comparisons are made for a variety of artificially generated nonlinear ARIMA data sets that simulate the characteristics of wastewater process variables and watershed variables, as well as two real-world wastewater data sets. While the time delay neural network model was more accurate for the two real-world wastewater data sets, the neural networks were not always more accurate than linear ARIMA for the artificial nonlinear data sets. In some cases of the artificial nonlinear data, where multi-period predictions are made, the linear ARIMA model provides a more accurate result than the time delay neural network.
